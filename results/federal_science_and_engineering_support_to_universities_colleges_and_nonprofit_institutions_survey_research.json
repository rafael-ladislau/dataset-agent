  "description": "The Federal Science and Engineering (S&E) Support to Universities, Colleges, and Nonprofit Institutions Survey is a dataset created by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) under the National Science Foundation (NSF). It compiles federal funding data for S&E research and development (R&D) provided to U.S. universities, colleges, and nonprofit institutions. The dataset aggregates obligations from 19 federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NIH, DOE) that fund S&E activities, tracking amounts, recipient institutions, and funding purposes. Originally a standalone survey through FY 2020, it transitioned into a module within the broader Federal Funds for R&D survey starting in FY 2021. Its primary purpose is to inform policymakers, researchers, and institutions about federal R&D investment trends, enabling analysis of geographic distribution, agency contributions, and institutional success in securing funding. Use cases include assessing state-level funding disparities, evaluating agency priorities, and benchmarking institutional research capacity. Key features include granular data on obligational amounts, agency-specific breakdowns, and longitudinal trends, making it a critical resource for understanding the U.S. federal R&D ecosystem. The dataset also highlights top recipient institutions, offering insights into academic research competitiveness.",
