We're continuing our implementation of Technical White Paper on Dataset Research Agent Capabilities and Proposed Improvements by implementing task group number 3:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 3: Propose Additional Improvements and SOW Application
**Assigned implementer:** api-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Group 2

- [ ] 3.0 Complete additional improvements and SOW mapping
  - [ ] 3.1 Write Section 5 - Three Additional Accuracy/Reliability Improvements
    - Improvement #3: Structured Output Schema with JSON Validation
      - Enforce strict JSON schema for agent outputs (aliases, organizations fields)
      - Validate outputs against schema before acceptance
      - Complexity: Low-Medium (schema definition, validation logic)
      - Expected impact: Reduce malformed outputs, ensure consistent structure
    - Improvement #4: Multi-Stage Verification with Consistency Prompts
      - Run agent twice: first for extraction, second for verification
      - Ask agent to verify extracted entities against original context
      - Flag inconsistencies for manual review
      - Complexity: Medium (requires dual-pass pipeline, consistency logic)
      - Expected impact: Catch hallucinations, improve precision
    - Improvement #5: Entity Type-Specific Prompt Templates
      - Create optimized prompts for different entity types (datasets, AI models, foundries)
      - Include domain-specific instructions and examples
      - Template variables for entity name, authoritative sources
      - Complexity: Low (prompt engineering, template system)
      - Expected impact: Better extraction for specialized entity types
  - [ ] 3.2 Write Section 6 - Application to SOW Tasks
    - Subsection 6.1: Task 1.1 - HuggingFace AI Model Mentions
      - Adapt deterministic search to query HuggingFace API for model metadata
      - Use model names (e.g., "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
      - Search Dimensions API for publications mentioning these models
      - Apply fine-tuned agent to extract model aliases and variations
      - Demonstrate generalization from datasets to AI models
    - Subsection 6.2: Task 1.2 - Synbio Foundry Mentions
      - Adapt deterministic search to scrape NSF/Agile Biofoundry consortium lists
      - Extract foundry names, acronyms from authoritative sources
      - Search BioRxiv and specialized journals for foundry mentions
      - Apply fine-tuned agent to identify foundry-associated authors
      - Demonstrate generalization from datasets to synbio entities
    - Subsection 6.3: Generalization Path
      - Show how improvements enable domain-agnostic entity resolution
      - Entity-specific configurations (authoritative sources, search queries)
      - Common pipeline: deterministic search → fine-tuned agent → validated output
  - [ ] 3.3 Write conclusion
    - Summarize five proposed improvements
    - Restate technical feasibility focus (no costs, timelines, implementation)
    - Emphasize 80% valid response rate as success metric
    - Highlight extensibility from datasets to other named entities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Three additional improvements are technically sound and accuracy-focused
- Each improvement has complexity assessment (Low, Medium, High)
- SOW Tasks 1.1 and 1.2 have dedicated subsections with clear mapping
- Generalization path demonstrates domain-agnostic approach
- Conclusion summarizes all five improvements and success metric

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2026-01-08-project-documentation-for-sow-response/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2026-01-08-project-documentation-for-sow-response/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:
